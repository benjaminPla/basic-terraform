## Terraform

1. Initialize the Terraform working directory:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

   This command initializes the working directory and downloads the necessary provider plugins specified in your configuration.

2. Validate the Terraform configuration:

   ```bash
   terraform validate
   ```

   This command validates the syntax and configuration of your Terraform files, ensuring they are correctly formatted and without errors.

3. Preview the Terraform execution plan:

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

   This command generates an execution plan, showing you the changes that Terraform will make to your infrastructure. It provides an overview of the resources that will be created, modified, or destroyed.

4. Apply the Terraform changes:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   This command applies the changes defined in your Terraform configuration, creating or modifying the specified resources. You may be prompted to confirm the changes before proceeding.

5. (Optional) Automate the Terraform execution:
   If you want to automate the Terraform execution without manual intervention, you can use the `-auto-approve` flag:

   ```bash
   terraform apply -auto-approve
   ```

   This will automatically apply the changes without requiring manual confirmation.

6. To destroy the resources provisioned by Terraform and remove them from your infrastructure, you can use the terraform destroy command. This command will destroy all the resources defined in your Terraform configuration.
   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```
